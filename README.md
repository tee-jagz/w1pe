# W1PE: Write Once, Post Everywhere README

## Project Overview

W1PE (Write Once, Post Everywhere) is an innovative tool designed to streamline the process of social media management. By allowing content creators to write a single message, W1PE automatically tailors this message to fit the unique formats and requirements of various social media platforms such as Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram. This tool is an efficient solution for creating engaging, platform-optimized content quickly.

## How to Use

1. Prepare your message and platform specifications in a JSON structure.
2. Use the `generate_social_media_posts` function to input your JSON data.
3. W1PE will output a JSON with platform names as keys and lists of tailored posts as values.
